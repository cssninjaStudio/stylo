## Chocolate Chip Muffin Recipe
A classic, warm, and gooey chocolate chip muffin is a treat that everyone loves! Here is a simple recipe that you can make at home with just a few ingredients. This recipe yields about 12 muffins, perfect for a sweet treat in the morning, as a snack, or to serve at a gathering.

## Ingredients:
* 2 cups of all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon of baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon of salt
* 1 cup of sugar
* 1 large egg
* 1/2 cup of unsalted butter, melted
* 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
* 1/2 cup of whole milk
* 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips

## Preparation:
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Line a muffin tin with paper liners or lightly grease it.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
4. In a large bowl, beat the sugar and egg until light and fluffy. Use an electric mixer or a whisk to get the desired texture.
5. Stir in the melted butter and vanilla extract. Make sure that the butter has cooled down before adding it to the mixture, otherwise it might cook the egg.
6. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture in three parts, alternating with the milk, starting and ending with the flour mixture. Gently mix until just combined, being careful not to overmix the batter. Overmixing the batter will result in dense, tough muffins.
7. Fold in the chocolate chips. You can add more or less, depending on your preference.
8. Scoop the batter evenly into the muffin tin, about 2/3 full.
9. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. Check the muffins after 15 minutes and rotate the tin for even baking.
10. Let the muffins cool in the tin for a few minutes, then remove and place on a wire rack to cool completely.

## Additional tips and tricks:
* For a fun twist, you can add in other ingredients such as nuts, fruit, or spices.
* To make mini muffins, reduce the baking time to 12-15 minutes.
* To make jumbo muffins, increase the baking time to 25-30 minutes.
* If you want a more intense chocolate flavor, you can use dark chocolate chips or add in cocoa powder to the batter.
* Muffins can be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days. You can also freeze them for up to 3 months, just be sure to wrap them tightly in plastic wrap before putting them in a freezer-safe bag.

And there you have it! Homemade chocolate chip muffins that are soft, fluffy, and loaded with melted chocolate in every bite. Enjoy these warm, straight from the oven, or store in an airtight container for a delicious treat later.

Bon appétit!
