## Bran Bread Recipe
If you're looking for a delicious and healthy bread recipe, try making this homemade bran bread. It's packed with fiber and nutritious ingredients, making it a great choice for breakfast or a snack. The bran flakes cereal adds a nice crunch and nutty flavor to the bread, while the buttermilk gives it a moist and tender texture. Here's what you'll need:

## Ingredients:

* 1 cup bran flakes cereal
* 1 cup boiling water
* 1 cup whole wheat flour
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 tablespoons brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 egg, beaten
* 1 cup buttermilk

## Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
2. Pour bran flakes cereal into a large mixing bowl and pour boiling water over the top. Let it sit for 10 minutes to soften. This will help the cereal to absorb the liquid and become tender, adding extra moisture to the bread.
3. In a separate bowl, mix together the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, brown sugar, baking soda, and salt.
4. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the cereal and mix until well combined.
5. Add the beaten egg and buttermilk to the bowl and mix until just combined. Don't overmix, as this can result in a tough bread. The batter will be thick, but that's okay.
6. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth the top. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean.
7. Let the bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Tips and Tricks:

* If you don't have buttermilk, you can make a substitute by mixing 1 cup of milk with 1 tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice. Let it sit for 5 minutes until * it thickens, then use it in the recipe.
* You can substitute the brown sugar with honey or maple syrup for a different flavor.
* For added flavor and nutrition, try adding in some nuts, seeds, or dried fruit to the batter before baking.
* This bread can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.
