## Chicken pizza recipe

Pizza is a classic dish that is loved by many people all over the world. If you're looking for a simple and delicious pizza recipe that you can make at home, try this classic homemade pizza recipe. It's a great way to have control over the ingredients and make a pizza that is tailored to your tastes. Here's what you'll need:

## Ingredients:

* 1 cup warm water (110-115°F)
* 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 package)
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1 cup pizza sauce
* 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
* Toppings of your choice (pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, etc.)

## Instructions:

1. In a large bowl, mix together the warm water, yeast, and olive oil. Let the mixture sit for 5 minutes until the yeast starts to foam.
2. In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, salt, and sugar.
3. Add the dry ingredients to the yeast mixture and stir until a soft dough forms.
4. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic.
5. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
6. Preheat oven to 425°F.
7. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness.
8. Transfer the dough to a pizza pan or baking sheet.
9. Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.
10. Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.
11. Add your toppings of choice.
12. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and the crust is golden brown.

# Tips and Tricks:

* You can make the dough ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.
* If you don't have a pizza pan, you can use a baking sheet or a pizza stone.
* Feel free to get creative with your toppings and use your favorite ingredients.
* To make a crispy crust, place a baking sheet on the bottom rack of the oven while it's preheating. This will create a hot surface for the pizza to cook on.
