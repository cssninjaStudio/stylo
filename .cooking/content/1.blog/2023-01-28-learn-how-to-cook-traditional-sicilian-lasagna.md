## Sicilian Lasagna Recipe

Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that is loved by people of all ages. It's a comfort food that is perfect for family dinners or special occasions. If you're looking to make your own delicious lasagna at home, try this simple and easy Sicilian-style recipe. You'll be able to control the ingredients and make a lasagna that is tailored to your tastes. Here's what you'll need:

## Ingredients:

* 1 pound lasagna noodles
* 1 pound ground beef or Italian sausage
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 2 cloves of garlic, minced
* 1 can (28 ounces) of crushed tomatoes
* 1 can (6 ounces) of tomato paste
* 1 teaspoon dried basil
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 1/2 cup of red wine
* 1 pound of ricotta cheese
* 2 cups of grated mozzarella cheese
* 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese
* Optional: fresh basil or parsley leaves, for garnish

## Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F.
2. Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.
3. In a large pan, brown the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium heat until fully cooked. Drain the excess fat and set aside.
4. In the same pan, add the onion and garlic and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes.
5. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper to the pan. Stir to combine.
6. Pour in the red wine and let the sauce simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until it has thickened.
7. In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, 1 cup of mozzarella cheese, and 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese.
8. In a large baking dish, spread a layer of the tomato sauce on the bottom. Then add a layer of lasagna noodles, followed by a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture. 9. Repeat this layering process until all ingredients are used, ending with a layer of tomato sauce on top.
10. Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese on top of the lasagna.
11. Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Then remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and golden brown.

## Tips and Tricks:

* You can use any type of ground meat, such as turkey or chicken, for a healthier option.
* For a vegetarian option, you can substitute the ground meat with sautéed vegetables like zucchini, bell peppers, and mushrooms.
* If you prefer a thicker sauce, you can add more tomato paste.
* You can add red pepper flakes or chili flakes for a bit of spice.
* You can also use fresh herbs like basil or oregano instead of dried for a more flavorful sauce.
