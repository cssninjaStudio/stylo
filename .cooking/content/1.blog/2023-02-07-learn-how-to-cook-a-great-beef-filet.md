## Meat filet recipe

Meat filet is a versatile and delicious cut of meat that is perfect for any occasion. Whether you're cooking for a special occasion or just a quick weeknight dinner, this simple meat filet recipe is sure to impress. Here's what you'll need:

## Ingredients:

* 4 (6-8 oz) beef filets
* 2 tablespoons of olive oil
* Salt and pepper
* 2 teaspoons of dried herbs (such as thyme, rosemary, and basil)
* 2 cloves of garlic, minced
* 1 lemon, cut into wedges
* 1 large onion, sliced
* 2 tablespoons of butter

## Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 400째F (200째C).
2. Pat the filets dry with paper towels and season both sides with salt and pepper.
3. In a small bowl, mix together the olive oil, dried herbs, and minced garlic.
4. Brush the mixture all over the filets, making sure to cover both sides.
5. Heat a large skillet over high heat. Add the filets to the skillet and sear on both sides until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes per side.
6. Remove the filets from the skillet and set aside.
7. In the same skillet, add the sliced onions and cook until they are soft and lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
8. Place the filets in an oven-proof dish and top each with a slice of lemon and a tablespoon of butter.
9. Roast the filets in the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 135째F (57째C) for medium-rare.
10. Let the filets rest for 5-10 minutes before serving.

## Tips and Tricks:

* To ensure even cooking, make sure the filets are of equal thickness.
* For added flavor, you can marinate the filets in a mixture of olive oil, herbs, garlic, and lemon juice for 2-4 hours before cooking.
* If you prefer a crispier crust, make sure to sear the filets over high heat.
* To make the dish more substantial, serve the filets with a side of roasted vegetables or mashed potatoes.
* For added richness, try adding a splash of red wine to the skillet when cooking the onions.
