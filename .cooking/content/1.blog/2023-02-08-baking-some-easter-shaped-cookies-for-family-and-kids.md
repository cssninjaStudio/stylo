Cookies are a classic treat that kids of all ages love. Whether they're helping you in the kitchen or just enjoying a sweet snack, these homemade cookies are sure to be a hit. Here's what you'll need:

## Ingredients:
* 2 1/4 cups of all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon of baking soda
* 1 teaspoon of salt
* 1 cup of unsalted butter, at room temperature
* 3/4 cup of granulated sugar
* 3/4 cup of brown sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract
* 2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
3. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.
4. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract.
5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing until just combined.
6. Stir in the chocolate chips.
7. Drop tablespoon-sized balls of dough onto a lightly greased baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
8. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden.
9. Remove from the oven and let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Tips and Tricks:
* For added variety, try using different types of chocolate chips or add in nuts, dried fruit, or candy pieces.
* To keep the cookies from spreading too much, make sure the dough is well chilled before baking.
* For a softer cookie, try using cake flour instead of all-purpose flour.
* To make the cookies extra special, sprinkle with decorative sugar or drizzle with melted chocolate.
