## Delicious Homemade Fruit Pie Recipe
There's nothing quite like a warm and flaky fruit pie straight from the oven. Whether you're in the mood for a classic apple pie, a juicy blueberry pie, or a sweet cherry pie, this recipe will have you covered. Here's what you'll need:

## Ingredients:
* 1 recipe for double pie crust (store-bought or homemade)
* 6 cups of your preferred fruit, peeled and chopped (e.g. apples, berries, cherries, peaches, etc.)
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 3 tablespoons cornstarch
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 1 teaspoon cinnamon (optional)
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
* 1 large egg, beaten (for egg wash)
* Coarse sugar, for sprinkling (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 400째F (200째C). Line a 9-inch (23 cm) pie dish with one of the pie crusts.
2. In a large bowl, mix together the fruit, sugar, cornstarch, salt, and cinnamon (if using). Spoon the mixture into the prepared pie crust and dot with the butter.
3. Roll out the remaining pie crust to a 1/8 inch (0.3 cm) thickness and cut into strips or decorative shapes. Arrange the strips or shapes over the top of the fruit mixture, crimping the edges to seal.
4. Brush the top of the pie with the beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse sugar, if desired. Cut several slits in the top to allow steam to escape.
5. Place the pie on a baking sheet and bake for 25 minutes. Reduce the heat to 375째F (190째C) and continue baking for an additional 25-35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.
6. Let the pie cool completely on a wire rack before slicing and serving.

## Tips and Tricks:
* Use seasonal and ripe fruit for the best flavor and texture.
* If the fruit is especially juicy, add an additional tablespoon of cornstarch to help thicken the filling.
* To prevent the crust from getting soggy, lightly brush the bottom of the pie crust with egg wash before adding the filling.
* For a lattice top, cut the rolled out pie crust into 1-inch (2.5 cm) wide strips and weave them over the filling in a lattice pattern.
* Store leftover pie in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat individual slices in the microwave or oven as desired.

Fruit pie is the perfect dessert for any occasion, and making it from scratch is a satisfying and delicious experience. With this recipe, you'll be able to create a flaky and flavorful pie that everyone will love. Happy baking!
