## Flavorful Homemade Moroccan Couscous Recipe
Couscous is a staple dish in Moroccan cuisine and is known for its delicate texture and versatility. It can be served as a side dish or as the main course, and is often paired with a variety of flavorful stews, vegetables, and spices. Here's how to make a delicious and authentic Moroccan couscous at home:

## Ingredients:
* 2 cups (300 g) of couscous
* 2 1/2 cups (600 ml) of water or broth
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 2 cloves of garlic, minced
* 2 carrots, peeled and diced
* 2 zucchini, diced
* 1 can (14 oz/400 g) of chickpeas, drained and rinsed
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon paprika
* 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* Fresh cilantro, chopped (optional)

## Instructions:
1. In a large bowl, mix together the couscous, water or broth, salt, and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Cover the bowl and let the couscous soak for 10-15 minutes, or until the liquid is absorbed.
2. Fluff the couscous with a fork to separate the grains.
3. In a large saucepan, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
4. Add the carrots, zucchini, chickpeas, cumin, paprika, turmeric, salt, and pepper to the saucepan and cook for an additional 10 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.
5. Stir the vegetable mixture into the couscous and mix well.
6. Serve the couscous topped with fresh cilantro, if desired.

## Tips and Tricks:
* If you want a more flavorful couscous, try using chicken, beef, or vegetable broth instead of water.
* For a vegetarian version of this dish, substitute the meat broth with vegetable broth and omit the meat.
* You can also add raisins, apricots, or dates to the couscous for a sweet and fruity twist.
* To add extra texture and flavor, try toasting the couscous in a dry pan before soaking it.
* Store leftover couscous in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stove.

This Moroccan couscous recipe is a delicious and satisfying dish that is perfect for any day of the week. With its combination of tender vegetables, fragrant spices, and fluffy couscous, it's sure to become a family favorite. Enjoy!
