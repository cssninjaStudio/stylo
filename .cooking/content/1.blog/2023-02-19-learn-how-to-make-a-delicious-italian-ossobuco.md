## A Delicious Ossobuco Recipe
Ossobuco, a classic Italian dish made with slow-cooked veal shanks, is a hearty and flavorful meal that's perfect for a cozy night in. This dish is known for its tender meat, rich sauce, and creamy polenta or risotto. Here's how to make a classic ossobuco at home:

## Ingredients:
* 4 veal shanks
* 1 onion, chopped
* 2 carrots, chopped
* 2 celery stalks, chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 cup (250 mL) dry white wine
* 1 can (28 oz/796 g) diced tomatoes
* 2 cups (500 mL) chicken broth
* 1 teaspoon dried thyme
* Salt and pepper, to taste
* 2 tablespoons (30 g) butter
* 1/4 cup (30 g) all-purpose flour
* Gremolata (optional):
* 1 lemon, zested
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 2 tablespoons (10 g) fresh parsley, chopped
* Polenta or risotto, for serving

## Instructions:
1. In a large dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of olive oil over medium-high heat.
2. Add the veal shanks and cook until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.
3. In the same pan, add the onion, carrots, celery, and garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.
4. Pour in the white wine and bring to a boil, scraping the bottom of the pan to release any browned bits.
5. Add the diced tomatoes, chicken broth, thyme, salt, and pepper to the pan. Stir to combine.
6. Return the veal shanks to the pan and bring the liquid to a simmer.
7. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let the ossobuco cook for 2-3 hours, or until the meat is very tender and the sauce is thick and flavorful.
8. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour and cook for 2 minutes, until the mixture is smooth and bubbly.
9. Stir the flour mixture into the ossobuco sauce, and cook until the sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes.
10. To make the gremolata, mix together the lemon zest, garlic, and parsley in a small bowl.
11. Serve the ossobuco over a bed of polenta or risotto, and sprinkle with the gremolata, if desired.

## Tips and Tricks:
* For a more intense flavor, try using beef or pork shanks instead of veal.
* If you prefer a thicker sauce, add more flour or cornstarch to the sauce when thickening.
* For added depth of flavor, try adding a bay leaf or rosemary to the sauce.
* If you like a slightly sweeter sauce, add a touch of brown sugar or honey to the sauce.
* Serve the ossobuco with a glass of dry red wine, such as Chianti or Barolo, for a classic Italian meal.
