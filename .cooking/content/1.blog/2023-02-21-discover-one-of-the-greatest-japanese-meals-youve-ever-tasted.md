Ramen, a Japanese noodle dish, is a satisfying and flavorful meal that's perfect for a cozy night in. This dish is known for its tender noodles, savory broth, and delicious toppings, making it a popular dish not just in Japan but all over the world. If you're looking to try making ramen at home, here's a recipe that's sure to impress.

## Ingredients:
* 4 packs of dried ramen noodles
* 4-6 cups of chicken or beef broth
* 2 tablespoons of soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons of miso paste
* 1 tablespoon of sake
* 1 tablespoon of mirin
* 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil
* 2 cloves of garlic, minced
* 1-inch piece of ginger, grated
* 2 green onions, thinly sliced
* Optional toppings: sliced pork, boiled eggs, sliced mushrooms, bean sprouts, nori seaweed, sesame seeds

## Method:
1. Cook the ramen noodles according to the instructions on the package. Drain and set aside.
2. In a pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger, and cook until fragrant.
3. Add the chicken or beef broth, soy sauce, miso paste, sake, and mirin to the pot. Stir well and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and let simmer for about 10 minutes.
4. In a separate pan, pan-fry your choice of toppings (e.g. sliced pork, mushrooms) until cooked.
5. To serve, divide the cooked noodles into bowls. Ladle the broth over the noodles, and top with the cooked toppings and sliced green onions.

## Tips and Tricks:
* You can also use chicken or vegetable stock in place of broth for a different flavor profile.
* Experiment with different seasonings and spices to find the flavor that you love.
* To add a bit of spice, try adding a pinch of red pepper flakes or a splash of chili oil to the broth.
* To make a vegetarian version of the dish, simply omit the meat and replace the broth with a vegetable stock.
