## About me

I am Maya Piretti, a highly skilled and experienced UI/UX
designer with over 5 years of experience in the industry. I
have a passion for creating intuitive and user-friendly
designs that not only look great, but also improve the
overall user experience.

I graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design with a
degree in Graphic Design, and have since worked with a
variety of clients, ranging from startups to large
corporations. I have a strong understanding of user-centered
design principles and am skilled in a variety of design
tools, including Sketch, Adobe XD, and InVision.

My design process is thorough and research-driven. I start
by conducting user research and creating personas to better
understand the needs of my target audience. I then create
wireframes and prototypes to test and iterate on my designs,
and finally, I create high-fidelity mockups that are used to
guide the development process.

I am a strong communicator and a collaborative team player.
I work closely with stakeholders and developers to ensure
that the final product meets the needs of the users and the
business. I am also a skilled problem solver and am able to
come up with creative solutions to complex design
challenges.
